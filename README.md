# TorchBear

A new CI / CD system with batteries included.

It's really new, though.  There aren't a lot of batteries included yet.

The idea is simply that when you include the tools everyone wants in the main product, instead of breaking them into plugins, they work better together.

So while extensibility is definitely part of the plan, TorchBear should work for most workflows without extension.

TorchBear is event-based, but dependency-based behaviour is layered on top, so they can be mixed.
